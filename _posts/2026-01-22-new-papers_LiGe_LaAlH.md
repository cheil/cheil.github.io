We are delighted to announce the publication of two exciting papers from our collaboration with experimental groups, both exploring novel materials under extreme pressure conditions.

## Superconducting LiSi and LiGe with Square Planar Nets

The paper [*Superconducting high pressure forms of LiSi and LiGe featuring square planar nets*](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5c02061), published in *Chemistry of Materials*, reports the synthesis of novel P4/mmm phases of lithium-silicon and lithium-germanium at ~12.5 GPa. These structures feature unusual square planar nets of Si or Ge atoms—a rare geometry for group IV elements. P4/mmm-LiGe can be recovered to ambient pressure as a metastable phase and exhibits superconductivity with a critical temperature of 6.3 K, confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our first-principles calculations predict similar behavior for LiSi (~6 K) and reveal that superconductivity originates from electron-phonon coupling in the square planar nets, representing a fundamentally different bonding motif than the three-bonded networks found in ambient-pressure phases.

## Investigation of La-Al-H and La-Si-H Systems at High Pressures

The second paper [*Investigation of the La-Al-H and La-Si-H systems at high pressures*](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c05140), published in *Inorganic Chemistry*, systematically explores lanthanum hydrides at pressures up to 20 GPa. We report the successfull synthesization of LaAlH<sub>6</sub> with rhombohedral structure containing octahedral [AlH<sub>6</sub>]<sup>-3</sup> units at remarkably low pressures (~2 GPa), much lower than initially predicted. Crystal structure prediction reveals that the La-Si-H system can form diverse hydrides: interstitial LaSiH at ambient pressure, and at 20 GPa both LaSiH<sub>2</sub> (predicted Tc ~10 K) and the semiconducting hydridosilicate LaSiH₇ with hypervalent [SiH<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes. While experiments provided evidence for LaSiH<sub>2</sub> formation, higher pressures appear necessary to fully stabilize hydrogen-rich phases.

These studies demonstrate the power of high-pressure synthesis combined with advanced computational methods for discovering materials with exotic structures and promising electronic properties.
