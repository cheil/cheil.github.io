Dear all,

I’m very happy to let you know that our article *Feasible Route to High-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Hydride Superconductivity* has been published in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 166001](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.166001) as an Editor’s suggestion.

In this work, we’ve conducted a high-throughput computation of a wide range of high-symmetry ternary hydrides across the periodic table at ambient pressure. After considering thermodynamic, dynamic, and magnetic stability, we’ve discovered a metastable ambient-pressure hydride superconductor, Mg2IrH6. Excitingly, it has a predicted critical temperature above 100 K, i.e., above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. We’ve also proposed a potential synthesis route for this superconductor via a structurally related insulator, Mg2IrH7, which is thermodynamically stable above 15 GPa. However, we acknowledge that there may be challenges in achieving this synthesis. We look forward to further exploring these possibilities and pushing the boundaries of materials science. Stay tuned for more updates on our journey!
