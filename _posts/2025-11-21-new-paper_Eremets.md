We are pleased to announce that our paper [Stability and Superconductivity of Ternary Polyhydrides](https://doi.org/10.1002/andp.202500467) has been published in *Annalen der Physik*.

This review examines five years of work (2020-2025) on alloying in hydrogen-rich superconductors. Our analysis reveals that disordered ternary superhydrides do not exceed the maximum *T*<sub>c</sub> of their binary parents, despite many theoretical predictions. However, alloying provides significant practical benefits: it stabilizes high-symmetry phases at much lower pressures (*T*<sub>c</sub> = 200 K near 110-120 GPa) and improves properties like vortex pinning and upper critical fields.

We also observe behavior consistent with Anderson's theorem: magnetic dopants suppress *T*<sub>c</sub>, while nonmagnetic additives leave it unchanged. Looking ahead, we propose that fully ordered ternary hydrides synthesized through controlled hydrogenation of intermetallic precursors represent a promising direction for future research.
