Congratulations to Roman Lucrezi, who successfully defended his PhD thesis today. In his PhD project, Roman investigated various material systems, focusing on niobium-based transition metal chalcogenides and binary and ternary hydrides. Using cutting-edge density-functional theory and other methodologies, the study addressed critical aspects such as stability, synthesizability, and phonon anharmonicity.

Key findings include detailed insights into the Nbâ€“S system's phase diagram, predictions of new high-temperature superconductors (SrSiH8 and BaSiH8), and clarifications on the superconducting properties of LuH3. The thesis also revisited topical hydride superconductors, shedding light on doping effects and electronic structure nuances.

This work not only advances our understanding of superconducting materials but also aims to inspire future research, bringing us closer to harnessing superconductivity's full potential for everyday applications. Congratulations to our newly minted PhD for this significant achievement!
