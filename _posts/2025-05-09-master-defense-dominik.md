We are happy to announce that Dominik Spath has successfully defended his master’s thesis on Friday, May 9, completing his master’s studies.

Dominik has been instrumental in developing the **IsoME** code, a Julia package for solving the isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The code is now officially part of the Julia package ecosystem and openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cheil/IsoME.jl). A detailed description of the method can be found in our [arXiv preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.03559).

His contributions have been essential to the project, and we greatly appreciate his work and dedication.

We congratulate him on this important milestone and wish him all the best for the future.  
**Best wishes from all of us at Computational Material Design @ TU Graz!**
