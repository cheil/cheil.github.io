Our group is excited to share our latest outreach effort — a YouTube video explaining the fascinating world of superconductors! 
The video delves into the unique properties of these materials, explaining how they work and why they hold such immense potential for future technologies.
Whether you’re a student, a researcher, or just curious about how these materials work, we hope you’ll find the content engaging and informative.

Check out the video on the TU Graz's YouTube channel here (only in German for the moment): [What is Superconductors?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-GYTrByU)

We hope this helps bring superconductors to a wider audience, and we look forward to future content that makes complex scientific topics accessible to everyone!
Feel free to share it, and let us know your thoughts in the comments!
