Most known high-temperature superconducting hydrides require extreme pressures to remain stable. Finding materials that are superconducting and also stable at or near ambient pressure is a central challenge in the field.

In our latest preprint ([arXiv:2505.22546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22546)), we report the **prediction and successful synthesis** of a new ternary hydride, **Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>**, which is both **metallic** and **recoverable at ambient pressure**.

*Ab initio* crystal structure prediction singled out Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> as the only thermodynamically stable ternary phase in the Mg–Pt–H system at low pressure. It was predicted to be both metallic and dynamically stable. We tested this directly: synthesized the compound at 8–25 GPa using laser-heated diamond anvil cells, and confirmed its structure with synchrotron X-ray diffraction.

Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> adopts a body-centered cubic structure made of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and linear [PtH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2−</sup> complexes. Unlike most hydrido complexes, which are insulating, this material is metallic. Electrical transport measurements show a clear superconducting transition with T<sub>c</sub> = **2.9 K** at ambient pressure.

This project was a **very collaborative effort**, involving contributions from theory and experiment across multiple institutions. From structure prediction to synthesis, structural characterization, and transport measurements, the work highlights the power of combining theoretical design with high-pressure experimental techniques.

We believe Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is a strong example of how complex hydrides can serve as a platform for low-pressure superconductivity, and we’re excited about what this means for future materials discovery.
