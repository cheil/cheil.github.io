We are pleased to announce that the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) has awarded our group a multi-year project titled **Computational Modeling of Real-World Alloy Superconductors** at Graz University of Technology. The goal is to turn *ab initio* simulations of conventional superconductors into **real-world predictions** by natively handling disorder, off-stoichiometry, and structural imperfections.

The project targets quantitative predictions for transition temperature, gap, and critical fields in technologically relevant transition-metal alloys and emerging alloys. We will build a unified first-principles framework for electron–phonon superconductivity that treats disorder and thermodynamics on equal footing, benchmark established alloys, and explore complex compositions. Core tools developed in the project will be released as open-source software.

The project is conducted in close collaboration with Sapienza University of Rome (Prof. Boeri) and the University of Vienna (Prof. Maurer).

**PhD opportunities:** Two PhD positions are expected to open soon. Profiles of interest include electronic-structure theory, superconductivity, numerical methods, and scientific software development. Experience with DFT or electron–phonon physics is a plus; computational skills are essential.

**Important:** Please do not send full applications yet. If you believe you are a strong match, you may send a brief enquiry to the PI including: a 2–3 sentence summary of your background and interests and a link to your CV or homepage. Formal calls with full instructions will follow.
