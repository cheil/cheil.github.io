We are excited to announce a **postdoctoral researcher position** in **Computational Materials Design** in our group at the Institute of Theoretical and Computational Physics at TU Graz.

The project focuses on investigating electron-phonon coupled superconductors using machine learning techniques combined with state-of-the-art DFT and DFPT methods. The successful candidate will explore novel and application-relevant material systems, working in close collaboration with international research groups in the UK and USA. This is an excellent opportunity to join an active research environment with modern HPC resources and contribute to cutting-edge research in computational materials science.

**Who we're looking for**  
A highly motivated researcher with a PhD in Physics or a similar field. Strong interest and experience in computational modelling of materials (DFT, DFPT) is essential, along with extensive experience employing machine learning techniques. We value candidates who are self-reliant, open to new challenges, and able to work effectively both independently and as part of a team.

**What the postdoc will involve**  
- Research and perform calculations in the field of electron-phonon mediated superconductors  
- Employ machine learning approaches for materials discovery and characterization  
- Collaborate with international partners in the UK and USA  

**What we offer**  
- Initial contract for 12 months, with possibility of extension  
- Annual gross salary of at least € 69,060.59 for a fulltime position  
- Collegial and friendly working atmosphere  
- Flexible working schedule with possibility for home office  
- Top research infrastructure and access to the latest technologies  
- Exciting opportunities for professional and personal development

**Expected start date:** February 1, 2025

**How to apply**  
Candidate selection will begin in January and continue until a suitable candidate has been found. Applications must be submitted **exclusively via the TU Graz job portal**:
