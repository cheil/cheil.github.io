We are pleased to announce that our joint theory–experiment work on superconducting hydrides has now been **published in Physical Review B** and selected as an **Editors’ Suggestion**:  
[Phys. Rev. B 112, 094513 (2025)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/hkx1-lytx)

In this study, we reported the **prediction and experimental realization** of the ternary hydride **Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>**, a rare case of a hydride that is **metallic, superconducting, and stable at ambient pressure**.  

Using *ab initio* crystal structure prediction, Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> emerged as the only low-pressure thermodynamically stable phase in the Mg–Pt–H system. Guided by this prediction, the compound was synthesized at 8–25 GPa in laser-heated diamond anvil cells and its structure confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction.  

The material crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and linear [PtH<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2−</sup> complexes. Unlike typical hydrido complexes, which tend to be insulating, Mg<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is metallic. Transport measurements demonstrate a clear superconducting transition with T<sub>c</sub> = **2.9 K** at ambient pressure.  

This publication highlights how **theoretical design and high-pressure synthesis** can come together to enable discovery of new superconductors that remain stable outside extreme conditions.  

We look forward to further exploring complex hydrides as a promising platform for ambient-pressure superconductivity.
