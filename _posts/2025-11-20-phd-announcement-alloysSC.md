We are happy to announce a **fully funded PhD position** in **Computational Modeling of Alloys** in our group at the Institute of Theoretical Physics / Computational Physics at TU Graz. (We'll have a related postdoc opening soon as well.)

The project explores how we can use advanced simulation methods to understand and predict the behaviour of complex alloy systems — from their atomic structure to their macroscopic properties, as discribed in more detail [here](https://cheil.github.io/blog/2025/new-project-alloyssc/). The successful candidate will join a collaborative and friendly research environment, work with modern HPC resources, and interact with partners across materials science and theoretical physics.

**Who we’re looking for**  
A motivated candidate with a Master’s degree in Physics, Materials Science, Computational Science, Engineering, or a related field. A strong interest in computational approaches, numerical methods, and programming (Fortran, C++, Python, etc.) is important. Curiosity, initiative, and the ability to work both independently and in a team are highly valued.

**What the PhD will involve**  
- Developing and applying computational models for alloy systems  
- Analysing simulation results and connecting them to physical behaviour  
- Presenting and publishing your findings  
- Contributing to the scientific life of the group

**How to apply**  
Applications must be submitted **exclusively via the TU Graz job portal**:  
[Apply here](https://jobs.tugraz.at/en/jobs/dbbbbb43-bcb2-7ca7-20e9-6903345d8630)

If you have questions about the position or the research environment, feel free to get in touch.
