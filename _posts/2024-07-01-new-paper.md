We are excited to announce that our latest research paper has been published in [Phys. Rev. B, 109, 224517 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224517). This study offers a comprehensive investigation into the superconducting state of the ruthenium-based ternary equiatomic compound, ScRuSi.

In our study, we explored the superconducting properties of ScRuSi using a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. Low-temperature resistivity measurements revealed a distinct superconducting phase transition in the orthorhombic structure of ScRuSi at a critical temperature (Tc) of 2.5K. Transverse-field muon spin rotation/relaxation (TF-muSR) analysis determined a gap-to-critical-temperature ratio of 2.7, aligning with previous heat capacity measurements. The temperature dependence of the superconducting normalized depolarization rate was fully described by the isotropic s-wave gap model. Zero-field muSR measurements indicated that the relaxation rate remains nearly identical below and above Tc, suggesting the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state.

First-principles calculations using the McMillan-Allen-Dynes equation yielded a Tc of 2.1K, closely matching the experimentally determined critical temperature. The coupling between low-frequency phonon modes and the transition metal d-orbital states plays a crucial role in the superconducting pairing mechanism of ScRuSi.

The integration of experimental data with theoretical models allowed us to achieve a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the superconducting nature of ScRuSi. Our findings provide valuable insights into its critical temperature, pairing symmetry, and the underlying electron-phonon coupling mechanism.

We invite you to read the full paper to explore these findings in detail. Thank you for your continued support and interest in our research.
