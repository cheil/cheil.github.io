## Hello there!
We just moved to this new website, which is the new internet home of our group. If you are interested in older blog posts, you can still find some at our [old place](https://chheil.wordpress.com/), which will no longer be maintained.

We are a young [research group](/team/) led by [*Christoph Heil*](/pi_cv/) that employs state-of-the-art computational methods to describe physical phenomena in materials, in particular superconductivity and lattice dynamics, completely from first principles.

If you want a brief introduction to superconductivity and why superconductors are such interesting and important materials, check out this video on TU Graz's YouTube channel (currently available only in German): [What is a Superconductor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-GYTrByU)

You can find us at the [Institute of Theoretical and Computational Physics](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/itpcp/home) at the [Graz University of Technology](https://tugraz.at), located in the beautiful city of Graz (Austria) at [Petersgasse 16](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MvZYhHWpL2VfXY6a9).
