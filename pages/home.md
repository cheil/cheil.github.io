## Hello there!

Welcome to the internet home of our group! If you're interested in blog posts dating before July 2024, you can still find them at our [old place](https://chheil.wordpress.com/), which is no longer being maintained.

We are a [research group](/team/) specializing in *computational materials design*, led by [*Christoph Heil*](/pi_cv/). Using state-of-the-art computational methods, we explore physical phenomena in materials—particularly superconductivity and lattice dynamics—completely from first principles.

If you'd like a brief introduction to superconductivity and why superconductors are such fascinating and important materials, check out this video on TU Graz's YouTube channel (currently available only in German): [What is a Superconductor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-GYTrByU), where I talk about superconductivity and its importance.

For more insights, you can also listen to these podcast episodes:
- [Talk Science to Me](https://letscast.fm/sites/talk-science-to-me-33062f96/episode/talk-science-to-me-29-supraleiter) (available in German)
- [Bridge the Gap](https://youtu.be/TehDJacB80I?si=7ljz1RJYFAyOBGhF)

You can find us at the [Institute of Theoretical and Computational Physics](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/itpcp/home) at the [Graz University of Technology](https://tugraz.at), located in the beautiful city of Graz (Austria) at [Petersgasse 16](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MvZYhHWpL2VfXY6a9).
