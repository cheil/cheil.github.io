Welcome to the new internet home of the [**Computational Material Design (CMD) Lab**](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/itpcp/research/computational-modelling-of-superconducting-materials) at the [Graz University of Technology (TU Graz)](https://www.tugraz.at/home).

We are a young [research group](/team/) led by [*Christoph Heil*](/pi_cv/) that employs state-of-the-art computational methods to describe physical phenomena in materials, in particular superconductivity and lattice dynamics, completely from first principles. 

If you want a brief introduction to superconductivity and why superconductors are such interesting and important materials, check out this video on TU Graz's YouTube channel (currently available only in German): [What is a Superconductor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-GYTrByU)

We also utilize the predictive power of our approach to model and design new materials with certain desired properties. Broken down into bullet points, the main topics of our current research are:

* Investigating superconductivity, charge-density waves, and their competition in reduced dimensions, in particular for transition metal chalcogenides.
* Searching for new superconducting carbon-based materials in the nano-regime, i.e., nanoribbons, nanosheets, etc.
* Understanding the superconducting phase in high-pressure hydrides and predicting new highest-Tc materials.


You can find more information on current projects in the [*Research Topics*](/research/projects/) section and if you want to know more or are looking for Bachelor and Master projects, don't hesitate to contact [*Christoph Heil*](/pi_cv/).
