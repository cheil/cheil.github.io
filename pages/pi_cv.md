## Introductory Video to Superconductivity
Together with the science communications department and the educational technology team of TU Graz we created a science outreach video that delves into the unique properties of superconducting materials, explaining how they work and why they hold such immense potential for future technologies. 

Check it out on the TU Graz's YouTube channel here (only in German for the moment): [What is a Superconductor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-GYTrByU)


## Podcast Interview
I was invited to the TU Graz Podcast [Talk Science to Me](https://letscast.fm/sites/talk-science-to-me-33062f96/episode/talk-science-to-me-29-supraleiter) to present and chat about the research in my group. It was great fun to do such a discussion and I hope it is of interest to some of you.

At the moment, the podcast is only available in German. It is planned to do a similar thing in English soon, but it won’t be released until later this year.
